Music Player that I made using java language on android studio.

Here is the Music player, an app we all love to use. 
I always thought of creating my own music player and  after learning the android course , here I am with my music player app. 
You can checkout the app and customize it the way you like. It is my first step towards step toward android development and I will try to upgrade the app in the near future.
